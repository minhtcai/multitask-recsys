## CS330 - Homework 0 - Multitask Training for Recommender Systems  
  
Implementation of a multi-task movie recommender system based on the classic Matrix Factorization [1] and Neural Collaborative Filtering [2] algorithms. In  
particular, we will build a model based on the BellKor solution to the Netflix Grand Prize  
challenge and extend it to predict both likely user-movie interactions and potential scores.
